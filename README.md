# NFT Project utilzing IPFS
~There are only exist 10 LearnWeb3 Punk NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
~User's are able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
~The metadata for the NFT's should be stored on IPFS

## Tech Stack
~Project uses a service called Pinata which will help us upload and pin content on IPFS in order to store associated metadata for each NFT.

~In this project I used Hardhat for an Ethereum development environment and framework. I go on to use React a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.

~The smart contract itself was written in Solidity language utilizing ethers.js which is a library that aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem

~Web3Modal library. Web3Modal is an easy to use library to help developers easily allow their users to connect to your dApps with all sorts of different wallets. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc) and WalletConnect

### Overview/Notes
The project highlights the need for storing metadata on a service like The interPlanetery filing system to reduce risk associated with cryptocurrency related projects.  Such services reduce the possibility of rugpulls in the space.
